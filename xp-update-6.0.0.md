# XP Update 6.0.0
Welcome to the complete Changelog for XP version 6!

# Intro
With this Update, we added a lot (and when i say a lot, i mean it) of performance improvements and new functions.
We also wanted to say thank you for all those great suggestions from you. We did our best to implement them into the new Update.

# Changelog
### Help Command Improvement
> Navigating through all the different commands is easier once again! You can now easily click through the pages using reactions.

### Premium Functions
> But it's the fancy Premium™️, because you don't need to pay us in order to be above the rest! Simply boost our official Support Server and you got access to some shiny new things such as not having to Vote in order to execute some Commands.
